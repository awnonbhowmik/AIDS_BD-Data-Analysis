# Data Analysis of AIDS in Bangladesh (2000-2024)

## Overview
This repository focuses on the data analysis of AIDS trends in Bangladesh from 2000 to 2024. The analysis includes key metrics such as infection rates, death rates, and relevant socioeconomic indicators like population growth, GDP per capita, and Human Development Index (HDI). The data has been sourced from credible institutions such as the World Bank, peer-reviewed journals, and national health statistics. The goal is to provide insights into the impact of AIDS on Bangladesh's development and identify patterns that inform public health strategies.

## Key Highlights

### 1. AIDS Trends
- Yearly trends of AIDS infections and deaths.
- Identification of peaks and troughs in infection rates.
- Analysis of factors contributing to changes in AIDS prevalence, including policy changes, public health campaigns, and shifts in social behavior.

### 2. Socioeconomic Indicators
- Population metrics: Total, urban, and rural populations.
- Economic indicators: GDP per capita trends.
- HDI trends and their correlation with health outcomes.

### 3. Key Findings
- Variability in AIDS infection rates with occasional surges, potentially driven by lapses in prevention programs, changes in funding, or societal stigma limiting healthcare access.
- Steady improvements in health and socioeconomic metrics.
- Urbanization and its role in public health challenges.
